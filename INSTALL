The RKNOBSynC R package is a package that use some of the GSL C library (note capitalization).

Installing gsl from source requires you to download and install GSL
first.  Ensure that you can compile and run a simple test program such
as the example program near the start of the gsl Reference Manual.

Some linux users report that is is possible to go to the Ubuntu
Software Center and install "GNU Scientific Library (GSL) --
development package", which has the name "libgsl0-dev".

In Fedora make sure that "gsl-devel" is install. You can try in the terminal
"dnf install gsl-devel"
